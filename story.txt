Philosophy is my favorite school subject. Yesterday, I learned about Machiavelli, and his ideas on what makes a good leader. He argues that a good leader does not equate to a moral person, since any leader should be willing to do immoral deeds for the benefit of their nation.
Additionally, I learned about Plato's argument against democracies and oligarchies. According to Plato, only the people who are rational (primarily philosphers) should lead a nation because they would not be tempted by their desires or blinded by the prospect of fame/money.
In general, Plato believed that human nature was divided into three sections -- head, heart, and stomach. He thought that certain people were born with an inclination to one section over the others. He believed that a perfect society was one where people followed their incilinations. For example, people who tended to follow their heads would be phliosophers, while people who followed their hearts would be soldiers. People who followed their stomach, in other words people who were lead by their desires, would have a job of lower rank/importance.
